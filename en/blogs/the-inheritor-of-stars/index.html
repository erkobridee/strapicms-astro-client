    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A destiny etched in the cosmos, a journey to the galactic heart.&quot;,
    &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Erko Bridee had always felt a pull towards the stars. Not just the romantic yearning of an armchair astronomer, but a deep, almost ancestral thrumming in his bones. He spent his nights staring at the Milky Way from his rooftop observatory, a dilapidated shed he&#39;d affectionately dubbed &#39;The Helm.&#39; One crisp evening, as a meteor shower painted streaks across the inky canvas, a different kind of light pulsed in the distant darkness – not falling, but _arriving_.\n\nIt landed without a whisper, a sleek, obsidian teardrop nestled in his overgrown backyard. It shimmered with an impossible, internal luminescence, and a single, elegant hatch slid open, revealing an interior of swirling starlight and intricate, unknown symbols. Cautiously, Erko approached.\n\nAs he stepped across the threshold, a gentle hum enveloped him. The symbols on the walls pulsed, coalescing into a shimmering holographic display. A serene, ethereal voice, without origin or gender, resonated directly in his mind. \&quot;Welcome, Designated Captain Erko Bridee. You have been recognized.\&quot;\n\nErko, dumbfounded, could only stammer, \&quot;Recognized? For what?\&quot;\n\n\&quot;For your lineage, your innate drive, and your capacity for exploration,\&quot; the voice replied, its tone unwavering. \&quot;This vessel, the _Stardust Drifter_, is a relic of a Level 9 civilization, dormant for millennia, awaiting its intended pilot. Your genetic markers align with the ancient protocols.\&quot;\n\nHe looked around the bridge, a symphony of advanced technology that defied comprehension. The controls weren&#39;t buttons or levers, but crystalline conduits that responded to his thoughts. \&quot;A Level 9 civilization?\&quot; he whispered, his mind reeling. Such a civilization was theoretical, capable of manipulating spacetime, even entire galaxies.\n\n\&quot;Indeed,\&quot; the voice affirmed. \&quot;Our mission, initiated eons ago, was to journey to the heart of the Milky Way, to witness the primordial energies that govern our galaxy. Circumstances dictated a pause, a long slumber. Now, the time is right. And you, Erko Bridee, are the one to complete it.\&quot;\n\nA map of the Milky Way materialized before him, the galactic core a blazing, enigmatic eye. Fear mingled with an exhilarating surge of purpose. He was just Erko, a man who fixed telescopes and dreamt of what lay beyond. Yet, this incredible machine, this echo of an impossibly advanced civilization, had chosen him.\n\nHe took a deep breath, his hand instinctively resting on a smooth, cool console. \&quot;Then let&#39;s go,\&quot; he declared, his voice gaining strength. \&quot;To the center of the galaxy.\&quot;\n\nThe _Stardust Drifter_ vibrated, a low, powerful thrum that resonated through Erko&#39;s very being. The backyard, his small corner of Earth, vanished in a blur as the ship ascended, piercing the atmosphere with silent grace. Earth shrank below, a marble of blue and white, then became a distant star as they slingshotted towards the unimaginable depths of the cosmos.\n\nErko, the unexpected captain, strapped himself into the pilot&#39;s chair. He was no longer just gazing at the stars; he was among them, destined for their incandescent heart. The pull he&#39;d always felt was no longer a yearning but a trajectory, a cosmic imperative. His adventure had just begun.\n&quot;,

        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Um destino gravado no cosmos, uma jornada épica rumo ao coração da Via Láctea.&quot;,
        &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Erko Bridee sempre sentiu um chamado vindo das estrelas. Não era apenas o anseio romântico de um astrônomo amador, mas um **latejar profundo**, quase ancestral, em seus ossos. Ele passava as noites observando a Via Láctea do alto de seu observatório caseiro — um galpão caindo aos pedaços que ele apelidara carinhosamente de \&quot;O Leme\&quot;. Em uma noite límpida, enquanto uma chuva de meteoros pintava riscos na tela de nanquim do céu, uma luz diferente **pulsou** na escuridão distante — ela não estava caindo, estava **chegando**.\n\nA nave pousou sem emitir um sussurro: uma **lágrima de obsidiana** polida aninhada em seu quintal tomado pelo mato. Ela **faiscava** com uma luminescência interna impossível. Uma única e elegante escotilha deslizou, revelando um interior feito de luz estelar turbulenta e símbolos complexos e desconhecidos. Cautelosamente, Erko se aproximou.\n\nAo cruzar o limiar, um **zumbido** suave o envolveu. Os símbolos nas paredes pulsaram, **condensando-se** em uma projeção holográfica cintilante. Uma voz serena e etérea, sem origem ou gênero definido, **ressoou diretamente em sua mente**: \&quot;Bem-vindo, Capitão Designado Erko Bridee. Você foi **reconhecido**.\&quot;\n\nErko, atônito, mal conseguiu gaguejar: \&quot;Reconhecido? Pelo quê?\&quot;\n\n\&quot;Por sua **linhagem**, seu ímpeto inato e sua **capacidade de exploração**\&quot;, respondeu a voz, em um tom inabalável. \&quot;Esta embarcação, a *Errante da Poeira Estelar*, é uma relíquia de uma **civilização de Nível 9**, adormecida por milênios à espera de seu piloto pretendido. Seus marcadores genéticos alinham-se aos protocolos antigos.\&quot;\n\nEle olhou ao redor da ponte de comando, uma sinfonia de tecnologia avançada que desafiava a compreensão humana. Os controles não eram botões ou alavancas, mas **condutos cristalinos** que respondiam aos seus pensamentos. \&quot;Uma civilização de Nível 9?\&quot;, sussurrou ele, com a mente girando. Tal civilização era teórica, capaz de manipular o **espaço-tempo** e até galáxias inteiras.\n\n\&quot;De fato\&quot;, afirmou a voz. \&quot;Nossa missão, iniciada há éons, era viajar até o **âmago da Via Láctea** para testemunhar as **energias primordiais** que governam nossa galáxia. Agora, o momento é chegado. E você, Erko Bridee, é quem irá completá-la.\&quot;\n\nEle respirou fundo, com a mão repousando instintivamente sobre um console liso e frio. \&quot;Então, vamos lá\&quot;, declarou ele, sua voz ganhando força. \&quot;Para o centro da galáxia.\&quot;\n\nA *Errante da Poeira Estelar* vibrou, um **rugido** baixo e poderoso que ecoou por todo o ser de Erko. O quintal desapareceu em um borrão enquanto a nave **ascendia**, perfurando a atmosfera com uma graça silenciosa. Erko, o capitão inesperado, não estava mais apenas olhando para as estrelas; ele **estava entre elas**, destinado ao seu coração incandescente.&quot;,
